## Entities

### Task

Fields:
- id: integer (auto-incremented)
- title: string (required, non-empty)
- description: string (optional)
- completed: boolean (default false)

Validation rules:
- title must be non-empty (reject empty or whitespace-only input)
- id must be integer when supplied by user for update/delete/toggle

State transitions:
- created -> (updated)* -> deleted
- completed flag toggles true <-> false

## Notes
- IDs allocated by in-memory store (monotonic integer counter)
- All changes are ephemeral and lost on process exit
- Tests should assert that task list is empty at startup

## Acceptance checks (for tasks implementation)
- Add task returns assigned integer id and completed=false
- Listing tasks shows id, title, completed, and description if present
- Updating partial fields only modifies provided fields
- Deleting removes the task and subsequent list does not include it
- Toggling flips the completed boolean
